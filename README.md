# Crystal-Growth-in-LNSE-glass

Growth of Lithium niobate crystal in an Er-doped lithium niobosilicate glass, hereafter called LNSE glass, is not a trivial problem because of the multiple species of atoms and their complicated interactions. This is further complicated by the fact that nucleation in real world is a stochastic process and hence non-trivial to deal with modeling techniques. We have used molecular dynamics simulation to understand seeded crystal growth of LiNbO3 crystal in a LNSE glass using tested interatomic potentials. 

Machine learning technique, developed within the group, will be used to group the atoms into crystal-like and glass-like based entirely on the feature value corresponding to each atom. This will be extended to study the equivalent crystal size at various snapshots during the seeded crystal growth process. 

The inclusion of Er and Si into the LiNbO3 glass further complicates the understanding of the seeded crystal growth of LiNbO3 crystal because following questions arise:
1) Do they support or oppose LiNbO3 crystal growth?
2) Do they incorporate themselves within the growing crystal?
3) If yes, what kind of defects are created?
4) How can the experimental results be validated using the MD simulation? 


The fun part is that the project involves analyzing very large datasets, often with millions of rows, involving simulations of crystal growth in LNSE glass. Python programming with various ML libraries like Tensorflow, sklearn, keras will be used to the fullest.
